## Deployment on Zeabur

### Quick Deploy

1. Fork this repository
2. Go to [Zeabur](https://zeabur.com/referral?referralCode=stelladai1028)
3. Create a new project
4. Import from GitHub and select your forked repository
5. Zeabur will automatically detect and deploy the Flask application

### Manual Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd Hooky
```

2. Push to your GitHub repository

3. In Zeabur dashboard:
   - Create new project
   - Add service from GitHub
   - Select your repository
   - Deploy automatically

### Environment Variables (Optional)

You can set these environment variables in Zeabur:
- `PORT`: Port number (default: 5000)
- `DEBUG`: Set to 'true' for debug mode (default: false)

## Local Development

**Note**: Most webhook providers require HTTPS endpoints and won't accept HTTP URLs. Local development with HTTP is only suitable for testing with tools like curl or Postman. For actual webhook integration, deploy to a cloud platform (like [Zeabur](https://zeabur.com/referral?referralCode=stelladai1028)) with HTTPS.

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Start the server:
```bash
python server.py
```

3. Open browser and visit:
```
http://localhost:5000
```

4. For testing locally:
   - Use tools like curl, Postman, or browser for manual testing
   - The local HTTP endpoint is: `http://localhost:5000/webhook`
   - **Important**: This HTTP URL cannot be used with real webhook services

5. For production webhook integration:
   - Deploy to a cloud platform (like [Zeabur](https://zeabur.com/referral?referralCode=stelladai1028)) to get HTTPS URL
   - Use the HTTPS webhook URL from your deployment

## API Endpoints
